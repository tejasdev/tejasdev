Hi, I'm Tejas Devaraj ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software developer with extensive experience in full-stack development, currently working at Mate-Studio. evolving from core web technologies to advanced frameworks and backend systems. My journey began with working on web applications using JavaScript, jQuery, and PL/SQL, and over the years, I've shifted towards modern full-stack development, specializing in React, TypeScript, Nest.js. I focus on building high-quality, maintainable, and scalable software solutions with strong expertise in CI/CD, testing, and code optimization.
